# BINA_FS21_Case-Study_COVID-19-Global-Vaccination
A comparison of the global vaccionation progress

This is a case study for the module Business Intelligence and Analytics (BINA) in Master of Science in Business Information Technology.

The following case study analyzes the global comparison of the COVID-19 vaccinations in the world. With the use of RStudio and Tableau, the project group has 3 objectives to examine. Therefore, following hypothesis have been created:

- H1: Rich countries progresses faster in the COVID-19 vaccinations than poor countries (measured by HDI).
- H2: There is an evident difference of the contintens between the approval of the vaccinations.
- H3: COVID-19 Vaccinations have a negative correlation for the death rate of the analyzed countries.

Please feel free to investigate our Case Study and our results.
