# Case-Study "COVID-19: Global Comparison of Vaccination Progress"

This is a case study for the module Business Intelligence and Analytics (BINA) in Master of Science in Business Information Technology.

The following case study analyzes the global comparison of the COVID-19 vaccinations in the world. With the use of RStudio and Tableau, the project group has 3 objectives to examine. Therefore, following hypothesis have been created:

- H1: Rich countries progresses faster in the COVID-19 vaccinations than poor countries (measured by HDI).
- H2: There is an evident difference of the continens between the approval of the vaccinations.
- H3: COVID-19 vaccinations have a negative correlation for the death rate of the analyzed countries.

Please feel free to check our case study and our results.
